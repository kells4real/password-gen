# password-gen
Python program to create very strong passwords for accounts. It also copies the password to clipboard for easy pasting, and saves the details of the website on a .txt file. I'm relatively new to github, any insight would be greatly appreciated. 

You would need to pip install pyperclip if you don't already have it installed.
