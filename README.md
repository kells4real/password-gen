# password-gen
Python Code to Create Very Strong Passwords for accounts. It also copies the password to clipboard for easy pasting, and saves the details of the website on a .txt file. I am only about a couple of months into python and programming, any insight would be greatly appreciated. 
You would need to pip install pyperclip if you don't already have it installed.
